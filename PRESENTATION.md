### Some of the use cases for AES-256 encryption:

- U.S. government entities such as the NSA and the military use AES encryption for secure communication and storage of data.
- Many devices, applications, and networks today use it to protect data at rest and in transit. Many SSDs (solid-state drives) employ AES encryption algorithms.
- All data stored in the Google Cloud is encrypted using the AES-256 standard by default.
- AWS, Oracle, and IBM also use the AES-256 encryption standard.
- WhatsApp messages are encrypted using the AES-256 encryption standard.
